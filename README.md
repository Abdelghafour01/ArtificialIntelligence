# ArtificialIntelligence
This code is a solver for the 15 puzzle using Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Greedy Breadth-First Search, or A* Algorithms, as a part of the CSC 3309 Course (Artificial Intelligence) at Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane. The code is written in Python 3.x.

## 1. Input:
The input of the program is the dimensions of the grid (x, y, z), followed by the initial state of the puzzle (numbers ranging from 1 to n, 0 represents the space). The last input of the program is the algorithm to be used (BFS, DFS, GBFS, Astar).

## 2. Output:
the output of the program will be the transition of the states that the program follows, as well as the values of any heuristic functions at each step (if used).

## 3. I/O Files:
Input and Output files can be used with the program. For naming conventions, use in.txt and out.txt respectively

## 4. Examples:
The file examples.txt contains examples of initial states and their corresponding goal state.
